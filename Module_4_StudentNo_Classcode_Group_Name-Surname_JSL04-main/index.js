let userPreference = 'Sugar-free'; 
console.log(userPreference ? userPreference : 'Regular'); 
//Checks if userPreference is truthy (not undefined) and prints it, otherwise defaults to "Regular".

let heartRate = 95; // Current heart rate in bpm
console.log(heartRate < 100 ? "Boost needed!" : "Energy Levels are High!");
